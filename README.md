#Random_password_generator 
Create a password of length N from a string which consists of all alphabets, numbers and special characters.
Once the password is created, check if it has a number and / or special character depending on the conditions.
This method ensures that there can be multiple numbers and special characters in our password.
Convert the password generator into a username recommendation system.
Given an input string (the email id) - recommend a username allowed by the system.
